:description: Use Hazelcast as a sidecar container for applications deployed on Kubernetes.

{description}

== Before you Begin

- https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker for Desktop] is good enough)
- https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker for Desktop], https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube] or https://microk8s.io/docs/install-alternatives[MicroK8s] is good enough)
- https://git-scm.com/[Git]
- Python
- `kubectl`

== Context

Hazelcast is usually deployed using one of two topologies:

- Embedded
- Client/Server

The *embedded* topology is dedicated to JVM-based applications. The application itself starts a Hazelcast member, which is simple to configure. Such approach also provides low-latency data access, because Hazelcast member runs on the same machine as the application. What's more, Hazelcast scales together with your application.

The *client/server* topology, on the other hand, can be used by any programming language for which Hazelcast Client is provided (https://hazelcast.org/clients-languages/[Java, .NET, C++, Node.js, Python, Go, Scala]). It also separates Hazelcast data from applications and let them scale separately.

Kubernetes allows you to have multiple containers in one Pod, which usually means having the main application container and a so-called "sidecar" container. With this approach, you can introduce a new Hazelcast topology, which would be somewhere between embedded and client/server.

image::hazelcast_sidecar.png[Hazelcast sidecar]

The *sidecar* topology brings the benefits of the *embedded* topology, because Hazelcast scales together with the application and both containers run on the same machine. However, the application can be written in any programming language, because it connects to the Hazelcast member, using the standard Hazelcast client libraries. What's more, https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Kubernetes Hazelcast auto-discovery] is currently implemented only for Java, but the Hazelcast Sidecar pattern makes auto-discovery available for all programming languages.

In this tutorial, you'll create a Python-based web service for the Hazelcast sidecar member. The web service will have two endpoints:

- `/put` for putting a value into a Hazelcast distributed map
- `/get` for getting a value from a Hazelcast distributed map

Hazelcast sidecar members from all Pods will form a Hazelcast cluster.

== Step 1. Create the Python Application

You can use any programming language for which Hazelcast Client is provided (https://hazelcast.org/clients-languages/[Java, .NET, C++, Node.js, Python, Go, Scala]) for this guide.
As a sample we will use the Python application from https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/kubernetes-sidecar[Hazelcast as Sidecar container].
First, setup a Python environment:

[source, shell]
----
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----
You can find the Python web service application (written with the Flask framework) in the `app.py` file. The most interesting part is the connection to the Hazelcast member.

[source, python]
----
hazelcastClient = HazelcastClient(
    cluster_name="dev"
)
----
In the example, we used `dev` for the cluster name. Adding members is not necessary due to the auto-discovery via the headless service.

Then, in the endpoint controller, we simply use the `hazelcastClient` as we always do.

[source, python]
----
map = hazelcastClient.get_map("map")
value = map.get(key)
----

== Step 2. Dockerize the Python Application

In the `Dockerfile` we install `Flask` and `hazelcast-client-python` Python packages. Then, we start the application on the default Flask port (5000).

You can build Docker image for the application and push it into your Docker Hub (change `leszko` to your Docker Hub account).

[source, shell]
----
$ docker build -t leszko/hazelcast-python-client .
$ docker push leszko/hazelcast-python-client
----

NOTE: If you don't have a Docker Hub account, or you don't want to use it, you can do one of the followings:

* Use `leszko/hazelcast-python-client` in all further steps
* Build image with your Kubernetes-related Docker host (then you don't need to push it):
- If you use Docker Desktop, then your local image is already accessible to Kubernetes
- If you use Minikube, then you need to execute eval $(minikube docker-env) before building the image
- If you use MicroK8s, follow the instructions on https://microk8s.io/docs/registry-built-in
- If you use Kubernetes from a Cloud platform, then you need to upload the image to their registry

== Step 3. Use Hazelcast as a Sidecar Deployment

The next step is to configure Python application container and Hazelcast member container to exist in the same Kubernetes Pod. We do in `statefulset.yaml`.

[source, yaml]
----
containers:
  - name: hazelcast
    image: hazelcast/hazelcast:5.3.0
    ports:
    - name: hazelcast
      containerPort: 5701
    ...
  - name: app
    image: leszko/hazelcast-python-client
    ports:
    - name: app
      containerPort: 5000
----

Apart from that, we configure the deployment to have 2 Pod replicas and a NodePort service to expose the Python application.

== Step 4. Deploy the Sidecar Application

Before running the deployment, we need to configure RBAC (needed for Hazelcast container to make calls to Kubernetes API) and store Hazelcast configuration in ConfigMap.

[source, shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
----

Finally, we can deploy our application with the sidecar Hazelcast member.

[source, shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml
----

== Step 5. Verify the Sidecar Application

You should see 2 Pods, each having 2 containers (`hazelcast` ans `app`).

[source, shell script]
----
$ kubectl get pods -l app=hazelcast-sidecar
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-sidecar-0   2/2     Running   2          1m
hazelcast-sidecar-1   2/2     Running   2          1m
----

We can check that Hazelcast members formed a cluster.

[source, shell script]
----
$ kubectl logs hazelcast-sidecar-0 hazelcast
...
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [10.172.2.28]:5701 - f9557e88-ec2f-4ce3-9ac5-745ef34c7080 this
	Member [10.172.1.10]:5701 - bd4a4316-ef81-4de2-b799-50664647bb35
]
----

You can also check that the Python application connected correctly to the Hazelcast cluster.

[source, shell script]
----
$ kubectl logs hazelcast-sidecar-0 app
...
Members [2] {
	Member [10.172.2.28]:5701 - f9557e88-ec2f-4ce3-9ac5-745ef34c7080
	Member [10.172.1.10]:5701 - bd4a4316-ef81-4de2-b799-50664647bb35
}
----

Finally, we can check the NodePort Service IP and Port and insert some data using `/put` and `/get` endpoints.

To check `<NODE-PORT>`, run the following command.

[source, shell script]
----
$ kubectl get service hazelcast-sidecar
NAME                TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
hazelcast-sidecar   NodePort   10.175.246.60   <none>        5000:32598/TCP   3m23s
----

In our case `<NODE-PORT>` is `32470`.

Checking `<NODE-IP>` depends on your Kubernetes:

- In case of Docker Desktop, it's `localhost`
- In case of Minikube, check it with `minikube ip`
- In case of MicroK8s, check it with `kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{ $.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}'`
- In case of Cloud platforms (and on-premise), check it with: `kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{ $.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="ExternalIP")].address}'`

Let's insert some data and then read it.

[source, shell script]
----
$ curl <NODE-IP>:<NODE-PORT>/put?key=someKey\&value=someValue
$ curl <NODE-IP>:<NODE-PORT>/get?key=someKey
someValue
----

== Summary

Hazelcast can be used as a sidecar in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Such approach can help in a number of use cases:

- Kubernetes Hazelcast *auto-discovery* for *non-JVM languages*
- *Emulating Embedded mode* for *non-JVM languages* (low latency, auto-scaling)
- *Consistent configuration* between Sidecar and Client/Server topologies (no difference in the code, only in Kubernetes YAML files)
- Clear *isolation* of Hazelcast and the application, but still having the benefits of the Embedded topology
